# About Me

Around 2008, I touched a **computer** for the first time. I had no idea what to do with it, but I knew I wanted to understand it.

In 2014, I started exploring programming, back then I was basically a *script kiddie* who loved messing around with websites using **PHP**. That same year, I was introduced to Linux, specifically **Ubuntu 14.04**.

By 2016, I began taking things more seriously: learning systems, networking, servers, and building stuff on my own. I’m still learning today—still breaking things, fixing them, and occasionally contributing to **open-source** projects.

People sometimes ask why I built this site. Honestly, I just enjoy sharing what I learn. I used to share things only with friends or in random Facebook groups, so I decided to put everything here instead—organized, searchable, and easier to revisit anytime.

## Trivia
1. **Icaksh** has been my username since 2008. It started from a photo of me edited on a Sony Ericsson phone and named **icaks** (from Wicaksono).
2. My debug soundtrack often leans into Japanese city pop — the kind that makes even a messy log file feel cinematic.
3. I can get weirdly emotional over songs like "Eki" — like, "why does this chord progression feel like a whole life?"
4. I'm the type to romanticize late-night work the way a Makoto Shinkai scene romanticizes rain, distance, and timing.
5. If a playlist hits the right mood, suddenly deploying infra at 2 AM feels like a coming-of-age montage.
6. I genuinely enjoy making anime-style overlays / collages for stories — like mixing personal life + aesthetics + tech identity.
7. Cinnabar (Houseki no Kuni) is basically my wife.
8. I love the contrast of "soft music, hard problems": city pop in the ears, servers and networks on the screen.
9. My first programming language was **PHP**, but to this day I’ve never built an app using Laravel.
10. I **never took any programming course** until 2020—everything I learned came from the internet.
11. Right now I prefer using **FreeBSD** for my personal servers over Linux, for reasons I can’t really explain here.
12. Because of trivia #10, I tend to prefer FreeBSD tools like **jails** instead of Docker.
13. I’m currently diving deeper into **Go**. It’s so fun that I often end up opening [golang.sucks](http://www.golang.sucks).
14. DevOps basically **complicates** things that should be simple… but for some reason, I enjoy it.
15. As of 2024, I **don’t have any professional certifications** yet (mainly because the exams are expensive).
